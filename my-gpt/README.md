# Character language-model checkpoints

The token-local embedding model remains intact as **Stage 1**. **Stage 2**
adds fixed causal averaging so tokens can communicate, without adding any
trainable parameters.

## Stage 1: embeddings

This stage separates character lookup from next-character prediction:

```text
(B, T) token IDs
    -> token embeddings + position embeddings
(B, T, C) internal representations
    -> linear language-model head
(B, T, V) logits
```

The code is split by responsibility:

- `data_utils.py` owns the vocabulary, encoding/decoding, data split, and batches.
- `model.py` defines `EmbeddingLanguageModel` and cropped generation.
- `training.py` owns seeding, evaluation, and optimization.
- `train.py` runs the checkpoint and prints its reports.
- `inspect_data.py` only inspects the corpus; importing it no longer trains.
- `test_stage1.py` verifies shapes, parameters, gradients, cropping, and the
  architectural ceiling.

All data paths are resolved relative to these scripts, so commands work from
the repository root.

## Run the checkpoint

Train the token + position model with the Stage 1 defaults:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py
```

Train the requested A/B experiment with matched token/head initialization and
the same sampled-batch stream. Every reported evaluation also reuses the same
fixed set of sampled blocks, making initial/final losses directly comparable:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py --compare-positions
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py --device cpu --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

Run the tests without third-party test tooling:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s .\my-gpt -p "test_*.py" -v
```

## What the ceiling check proves

`train.py` constructs two contexts whose final token is identical but whose
earlier tokens are all different. Their final-position logits remain exactly
the same. Each position is still processed independently, so a context window
of eight tokens is only an input-size limit—not eight-token understanding.

There is an additional subtlety in this particular model. Because the head is
linear,

```text
W(token_embedding + position_embedding) + bias
```

is just a token-dependent term plus a position-dependent term. Position does
not create token-to-token communication (or even a token-by-position
interaction). Attention is the next ingredient that will let information move
between positions.

## Stage 2: fixed causal averaging

`causal_average_model.py` defines `CausalAverageLanguageModel`. After adding
token and position embeddings, it applies this fixed lower-triangular
operation:

```text
position 0 <- position 0
position 1 <- average(positions 0, 1)
position 2 <- average(positions 0, 1, 2)
...
```

The `tril` connectivity matrix is a registered buffer, not a parameter. With
the default vocabulary, context, and embedding sizes, both Stage 1 and Stage 2
therefore have exactly 4,481 trainable parameters.

Run the new checkpoint:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\03_causal_average.py
```

Run a matched comparison against the retained Stage 1 model. Both models use
identical learned-parameter initialization, training batches, and evaluation
batches:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\03_causal_average.py --compare-embedding
```

Quick CPU smoke comparison:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\03_causal_average.py --compare-embedding `
    --device cpu --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

The Stage 1 prefix test remains exactly zero. With the default multi-token
context, the Stage 2 prefix test is non-zero because changing an earlier token
now changes the averaged final representation. The weights are still uniform
and fixed; learned Q/K/V self-attention is the intended next checkpoint.

## Stage 3: one causal self-attention head

`04_single_head_attention.py` replaces the fixed average with one learned
query/key/value head. It prints the full Stage 3 diagnostic set: parameter and
shape reports, normalization and causal-mask checks, prefix sensitivity,
initial/final losses, generated text, and the learned attention matrix for an
eight-character input.

Run the full FP32/eager checkpoint (5,000 steps at a `1e-3` learning rate):

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\04_single_head_attention.py
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\04_single_head_attention.py --device cpu `
    --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

The default attention probe is `"To be or"`. Use `--attention-text` to inspect
another non-empty string no longer than `block_size` whose characters occur in
the training corpus.

## Stage 4: four causal self-attention heads

`05_multi_head_attention.py` splits the 32 representation channels across four
independent heads. Each head produces eight channels and its own causal
attention matrix; concatenating the four outputs restores `(B,T,32)`. There is
still no output projection, residual connection, feed-forward network, or
LayerNorm, so the experiment isolates multi-head routing while retaining the
same 7,553 trainable parameters as Stage 3.

Run the full checkpoint with the Stage 3 training conditions:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\05_multi_head_attention.py
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\05_multi_head_attention.py --device cpu `
    --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

The report includes per-head Q/K/V shapes, combined attention weights with
shape `(B,H,T,T)`, row-sum and causal-mask checks, train/validation loss,
generated text, all four learned attention matrices, and each head's routing
distribution for the final character of `"To be or"`.

## Stage 5: position-wise feed-forward network

`05_feed_forward.py` keeps the four causal attention heads and adds a ReLU
feed-forward network after them:

```text
(B,T,32) -> Linear(32,128) -> ReLU -> Linear(128,32) -> (B,T,32)
```

The FFN is applied independently at every position. This stage intentionally
still has no residual connection, LayerNorm, dropout, attention output
projection, or GELU. With the default dimensions, the FFN contributes 8,352
parameters and the complete model has 15,905 trainable parameters.

Run the full 5,000-step checkpoint:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\05_feed_forward.py
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\05_feed_forward.py --device cpu `
    --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

The report prints the `(B,T,4C)` hidden shape, verifies attention remains
normalized and causal, and performs a direct FFN locality experiment: changing
only position 0 must leave the FFN outputs at positions 1 through 7 exactly
unchanged.

## Stage 6: residual connections

`06_residual_connections.py` preserves the Stage 5 attention and FFN modules
and changes only how their outputs update the representation:

```python
x = x + self.sa(x)
x = x + self.ffwd(x)
```

Both additions preserve `(B,T,C)`, add no trainable parameters, and leave the
complete model at exactly 15,905 parameters. The checkpoint reports `x0`, both
sublayer updates, both post-residual representations, and their norms. It also
retains the causal-attention and position-wise FFN checks from Stage 5.

Run the full 5,000-step checkpoint with the same controlled settings as Stage
5:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\06_residual_connections.py
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\06_residual_connections.py --device cpu `
    --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

`test_residual_connections.py` additionally proves the exact two-addition
dataflow, the zero-update identity behavior, the direct residual gradient
route, unchanged parameter count, and causal masking.

# Stage 1: embeddings

This stage separates character lookup from next-character prediction:

```text
(B, T) token IDs
    -> token embeddings + position embeddings
(B, T, C) internal representations
    -> linear language-model head
(B, T, V) logits
```

The code is split by responsibility:

- `data_utils.py` owns the vocabulary, encoding/decoding, data split, and batches.
- `model.py` defines `EmbeddingLanguageModel` and cropped generation.
- `training.py` owns seeding, evaluation, and optimization.
- `train.py` runs the checkpoint and prints its reports.
- `inspect_data.py` only inspects the corpus; importing it no longer trains.
- `test_stage1.py` verifies shapes, parameters, gradients, cropping, and the
  architectural ceiling.

All data paths are resolved relative to these scripts, so commands work from
the repository root.

## Run the checkpoint

Train the token + position model with the Stage 1 defaults:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py
```

Train the requested A/B experiment with matched token/head initialization and
the same sampled-batch stream. Every reported evaluation also reuses the same
fixed set of sampled blocks, making initial/final losses directly comparable:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py --compare-positions
```

Run a quick CPU smoke check:

```powershell
python .\my-gpt\train.py --device cpu --max-iters 10 --eval-iters 2 --sample-length 40
```

Run the tests without third-party test tooling:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s .\my-gpt -p "test_*.py" -v
```

## What the ceiling check proves

`train.py` constructs two contexts whose final token is identical but whose
earlier tokens are all different. Their final-position logits remain exactly
the same. Each position is still processed independently, so a context window
of eight tokens is only an input-size limit—not eight-token understanding.

There is an additional subtlety in this particular model. Because the head is
linear,

```text
W(token_embedding + position_embedding) + bias
```

is just a token-dependent term plus a position-dependent term. Position does
not create token-to-token communication (or even a token-by-position
interaction). Attention is the next ingredient that will let information move
between positions.
